/* There is a bus moving in the city which takes and drops some people at each bus stop.
 * You are provided with a list (or array) of integer pairs.
 * Elements of each pair represent the number of people that get on the bus (the first item) and
 * the number of people that get off the bus (the second item) at a bus stop.
 * Your task is to return the number of people who are still on the bus after the last bus stop (after the last array).
 * Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus might not be empty and some people might still be inside the bus,
 * they are probably sleeping there :D
 * Please keep in mind that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the returned integer can't be negative.
 * The second value in the first pair in the array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.
